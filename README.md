# Facelauncher

A Ruby interface to the Facelauncher API.

## Installation
Facelauncher is currently served from its Git repository, so it is necessary to include the following in your Gemfile:

```

## Documentation

## Configuration
Facelauncher API v1.0 requires basic authentication using the application's program ID as the key, and program access key as the password.

The following global configuration options must be set in the `Facelauncher::Engine.configure` block, which should be placed in a file in your application's `config/initializers` directory.

```ruby
Facelauncher::Engine.configure do
  config.server_url = "http://bigfuel-facelauncher-staging.herokuapp.com/"

  # The program_id and program_access_key fields are required in order to
  # have access to the Facelauncher API.
  config.program_id = '<PROGRAM_ID>'
  config.program_access_key = '<PROGRAM_ACCESS_KEY>'
  config.program_app_id = '<APP_ID>'

  config.cache_expiration = 15.minutes
end
```

The above values can optionally be set using the following environment values:

```
FACELAUNCHER_URL
FACELAUNCHER_PROGRAM_ID
FACELAUNCHER_PROGRAM_ACCESS_KEY
FACELAUNCHER_APP_ID
FACELAUNCHER_CACHE_EXPIRATION
```
